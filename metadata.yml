Status: In progress
Title: Drug-likeness scoring based on unsupervised learning
Description: Unsupervised RNN-based language model trained only on known drugs, predicting
  drug-likeness scores that reflect progression through drug development stages, without
  relying on negative samples or overconfident binary outputs.
Deployment:
- Local
Source: Local

Task: Annotation
Subtask: Property calculation or prediction
Input:
- Compound
Input Dimension: 1
Output:
- Score
Output Dimension: 1
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: 'The higher the score, the higher the drug-likeness. FDA average value is 79.4. ChEMBL average value is 64.1. GDB-17 average value is 39.4.'
