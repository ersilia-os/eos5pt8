Status: Ready
Title: Drug-likeness scoring based on unsupervised learning
Description: Unsupervised RNN-based language model trained only on known drugs, 
  predicting drug-likeness scores that reflect progression through drug 
  development stages, without relying on negative samples or overconfident 
  binary outputs.
Deployment:
  - Local
Source: Local
Source Type: External
Task: Annotation
Subtask: Property calculation or prediction
Input:
  - Compound
Input Dimension: 1
Output:
  - Score
Output Dimension: 1
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: The higher the score, the higher the drug-likeness. FDA average 
  value is 79.4. ChEMBL average value is 64.1. GDB-17 average value is 39.4.
